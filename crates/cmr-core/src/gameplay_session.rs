//! The driven top-level session: [`GameSession`] plus the fixed-step race sim,
//! advanced from **injected per-frame controls** and reporting the per-frame
//! render route.
//!
//! [`GameSession`] already runs the recovered FSM from boot to quit, deferring
//! the gameplay band (`5..=0xb`) to a caller handler. This driver supplies that
//! handler: in state `5` (the main driving tick) it steps the deterministic
//! [`RaceState`] with the frame's [`Controls`] and feeds the car position to a
//! caller-owned [`StageProgress`] (the recovered checkpoint tracker) that raises
//! the finish; every in-race transition is the recovered
//! [`race_flow_next`] table. The same driver backs both the headless path (fixed
//! controls each frame) and the windowed path (live controls from the recovered
//! keyboard chain), so they drive identical logic.
//!
//! Presentation is not performed here: each [`advance`](GameplaySession::advance)
//! reports the [`RenderRoute`] of the state whose render handler ran this frame
//! ([`FramePlan::render`]), and the backend presents accordingly. The in-race
//! sequencer flags that are not the player's doing (replay/flyby/fade/quit) are a
//! documented [`InRaceScript`] harness stand-in until those subsystems are wired;
//! only `stage_finished` comes from the live tracker.
