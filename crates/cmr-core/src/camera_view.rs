//! The unified in-race **camera view controller** (`rea.official-eu.camera-modes`):
//! the per-frame camera driver / slot evaluator (`FUN_004343a0`/`FUN_00436490`)
//! that holds the active [`CameraMode`], advances it on the player's "next view"
//! input ([`camera_mode::cycle_next_view`]), and dispatches each frame to the
//! matching reconstructed placement to produce the camera world matrix.
//!
//! This ties the camera modules together into one driver the windowed session
//! can hold: chase ([`gameplay_camera`]) with its orientation ease, cockpit/mirror
//! ([`camera_interior`]), and the cinematic replay/TV cams ([`camera_cinematic`]).
//!
//! It reproduces the recovered **double-buffered mode-change crossfade** of
//! `FUN_004343a0`: a player "next view" request copies the live camera into the
//! other of two slots, retargets it to the new mode, and starts a countdown; each
//! frame while the countdown runs, **both** the old (A) and new (B) slot cameras
//! are re-evaluated live from the car pose and blended by the recovered weight
//! ([`camera_crossfade::blend_weight_q16`]/[`camera_crossfade::blend_pose`]), with
//! the displayed mode held at [`CameraMode::Blending`]; when it drains the new
//! slot becomes active. The helmet look overlay and the trackside director are
//! their own (recovered) modules and are not folded in here; modes without a
//! self-contained placement fall back to the chase camera.
