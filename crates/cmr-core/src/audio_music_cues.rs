//! Reconstruction of the music and start-of-stage countdown play paths.
//!
//! Two non-engine playback cues recovered together:
//!
//! - **Music** (frontend/replay): each is a single wave loaded *whole* (not
//!   streamed) through the managed-handle loader variant `FUN_004959f0` and
//!   played **looping** (`QSWaveMixPlayEx` dwFlags `0xffffffff`) on its own
//!   slot/channel pair. Frontend start is `FUN_00443b20` (one-shot init from the
//!   frontend init `FUN_00437ac0`); a second instance `FUN_004c9d70` is a
//!   per-frame keep-alive that re-starts the loop when the channel reports done
//!   and ramps a fade-in. Replay music (`replay.wav`) and the setup-screen
//!   `SETUP.WAV` build their paths inline and load through the same
//!   `FUN_004959f0` variant. All are gated by the sound-disabled flag
//!   `DAT_00d3ca88`.
//! - **Start-of-stage countdown** (`5-4-3-2-1-GO`): preloader `FUN_0046a740`
//!   ("PreSnd") loads six `countdwn\` waves into consecutive slots from a base
//!   (`DAT_00592ed8`) with the base loader `FUN_004958e0(path, 0x2b11, 0x10, 0)`
//!   (11025 Hz / 16-bit / mono), under `<speech base>` + `<language dir>` +
//!   `countdwn\`. In rally-school mode (`DAT_005f1e20 >= 2`) it additionally
//!   preloads the `intro2\` set. Play helper `FUN_0046af10(index)` plays slot
//!   `base + index` **one-shot** (`dwFlags 0`) on a shared SFX channel; the
//!   cadence driver is `FUN_00439b10`.
//!
//! The managed-handle loader `FUN_004959f0` differs from the base loader
//! `FUN_004958e0` by taking fixed format arguments and recording the returned
//! wave handle in a persistent table (stride `0x43`, counter `DAT_00a1f848`,
//! mixer handle `DAT_00a1f840`, ready flag `DAT_00a1f838`) - the "long-lived
//! looped wave" path, vs. the base "bulk SFX/speech slot" path.
//!
//! Observations: music is a single looped wave via `FUN_004959f0`; the two
//! music instances and their distinct globals; the countdown file set, its
//! 11025/16/mono format, one-shot play of slot `base+index`, and the `intro2\`
//! tutorial set. Inferences: `DAT_00d3ca88` is the sound-disabled gate; the two
//! music instances are the attract/menu variants. Unknowns (not reproduced):
//! the countdown index->value slot mapping and the `FUN_00439b10` tick cadence,
//! and the replay/SETUP control flow (their enclosing functions were not bound
//! by the decompiler). See evidence `rea.official-eu.audio-music-countdown`.
//!
//! # Music selection and lifecycle (H05)
//!
//! **Recorded decisive negative result: the retail EU build plays no
//! CD / Redbook / MCI music whatsoever.** `WINMM.dll` is imported and its MCI
//! interface (`mciSendCommandA`/`mciGetDeviceIDA`) is used, but every MCI call
//! targets the `avivideo` device for full-motion video (see
//! [`crate::intro_video`]), never a `cdaudio` device; there is no
//! `mciSendStringA`, no `auxGetNumDevs`/`auxSetVolume` CD-volume control, and no
//! `cdaudio`/`mci`/`music` command strings. Game music is exclusively the QSound
//! PCM `.wav` path (the two [`MusicTrack`]s). A faithful reconstruction must not
//! implement any CD/MCI music subsystem.
//!
//! "Which music plays" is therefore not a PCM-vs-CD choice but a pure context
//! choice. The global context flag `DAT_00d3ca88` (frontend-vs-in-race) gates
//! playback: frontend music (`FUN_00443b20`) and the stage countdown
//! (`FUN_0046a740`) start **only when it is `0`** ([`FRONTEND_CONTEXT`] /
//! [`frontend_music_active`]); the frontend context loops `frontend.wav`, the
//! replay context loops `replay.wav`, and in-stage there is no background music.
//! Start (`FUN_00443b20`) loads the whole wave, sets the volume from the config
//! byte `DAT_00d3ca80 + 7` ([`music_volume`]: `(byte & 0x7f) * 400000 / 100`),
//! and plays looping (loop count `0xffffffff`). The per-frame keep-alive
//! `FUN_004c9d70` ([`music_keepalive`]) performs a fade-in ramp toward a target
//! derived from a second config block (`0x00d3ac60 + 0xf`, [`music_fade_target`]:
//! `(byte & 0x7f) * 0x14`) while the voice plays, and reloads + restarts the
//! loop when the voice drains. This resolves the H02 "volume scaling units
//! unknown" note (the scaling is recovered; the absolute QMixer units it feeds
//! remain a mixer-backend policy). The replay-context start site itself was not
//! bound by the decompiler, so [`frontend_music_active`] models only the
//! recovered frontend gate.
//!
//! The config byte offsets are source-root-independent structural metadata; no
//! CD subsystem, no MCI music path, and no payload bytes are reproduced.
