# Reconstruction roadmap

The project advances by evidence-backed vertical slices. A subsystem is not
“done” because pseudocode exists; it is done when a clean implementation has a
repeatable compatibility check at the strongest practical boundary.

## Architecture direction

Keep recovered game behavior independent of the host platform:

```text
user-owned installation
        |
        v
verified importer ---> ignored runtime-data/
                            |
                            v

                            |
              +-------------+-------------+
              |                           |
      compatibility backend         native host / modern backend
      (recovery oracle)              (SDL3; GPU choice benchmarked)
```

The compatibility backend exists to establish the original contract. The
modern backend is allowed to differ internally, not observably where the
compatibility specification applies.

## Milestone 0 — provenance and safe workspace

Deliverables:

- exact hashes, sizes, PE identities, and analysis-tool versions;
- read-only inventory of installation contents and patches;
- asset exclusion rules and importer design;
- evidence ledger format and initial unknowns;
- subsystem map and ordered recovery backlog.

Exit gate:

- another developer can reproduce the inventories without copying source media
  into Git;
- observations are attributable to exact artifact hashes;
- reference edition/region ambiguity is explicit.

Reference policy: use the official EU updater payload as the canonical clean
code artifact. Keep the installed EU-derived executable and both supplied
xdelta outputs as comparison variants. Treat the official US payload as a
separate regional target; its differences are too broad to model as resources
alone. This policy may expand when original-disc evidence becomes available.

## Milestone 1 — executable map and data contracts

Recover both executables before assigning their roles. Build a function map from
entry points, imports, strings, references, and call clusters. Prioritize
boundaries that reveal stable contracts:

1. startup, command line, registry/configuration, and executable handoff;
2. filesystem lookup, case/separator rules, gzip/`CMPR` unwrapping, and
   archive/resource loading;
3. frontend state, localization, save/config persistence;
4. timing, input, rendering, audio, CD/music, and networking;
5. car/track loading, physics state, AI, race rules, replay, and results.

Initial static evidence identifies `Game.exe` as a video/launcher frontend that
starts `Rally.exe`. Reconstruct it as a separable launcher/presentation concern;
do not let its DirectShow-era lifecycle contaminate the game core.

Deliverables:

- versioned function/symbol map linked to REA Evidence IDs;
- format specifications with bounded parsers and synthetic fixtures;
- compatibility interfaces for clock, input, video, audio, storage, and network;
- reviewed reconstruction obligations with owners and verification methods.

Exit gate:

- each high-priority boundary has an observation, a bounded inference, or a
  named unknown with a next query;
- no format parser depends on game payloads in the test suite.

## Milestone 2 — first compatible vertical slice

Implement the smallest path that exercises real contracts end to end:

- locate and validate user data;
- parse configuration and localization;
- create a window and deterministic clock/input loop;
- render one frontend state using imported resources;
- exit cleanly while preserving expected configuration behavior.

Preferred implementation language is Rust unless recovered ABI/layout evidence
makes a narrow C/C++ module materially safer. Do not translate entire decompiler
listings mechanically; recover named domain behavior and explicit data layouts.
Every completed recovered behavior lands with deterministic unit tests in the
same milestone. Shared backend contracts supplement, rather than replace,
focused boundary and failure tests; no later subsystem may depend on an
untested compatibility rule.

Current implemented portion: reviewed asset-store loading now reaches startup
art and fixed-width frontend/game localization tables; configuration has an
opaque exact-size load model and a tested caller-owned write boundary; indexed
startup presentation runs against the deterministic software backend. The
first/root frontend state, fixed-layout font parsing, byte-text layout, input,
window-loop, timing, and root-menu visual rules are pure tested contracts. All
16 font styles and the four present root-menu artwork rows resolve through the
verified import; the loader's distinct Italian row is explicitly absent from
the reviewed corpus. Root bitmaps now reach fixed-slot indexed surfaces without
backend mutation, and both persistent font and root-bitmap pools now use a
tested shared source store without monopolizing the backend. Transaction,
fixed-slot, and mixed-pool tests cover 33 coexisting sources, optional upload
holes, isolated required rollback, repeated-frame reuse, and global teardown.
Host clock/input, native window creation, and a host adapter for the recovered
presentation executor remain before the vertical-slice exit gate. Complete
root frames can now be composed and captured by the deterministic headless
backend, without assigning native display semantics to that test oracle.
Root-footer text reaches a tested software back-buffer pixel through
localization, the shared store, and the persistent font pool. Root visual
transcripts name fixed bitmap slots directly, and the bitmap executor now
submits their exact opaque/keyed plans with checked geometry and no per-frame
uploads. A sequential frame dispatcher preserves bitmap/footer/C3D/scene/
presentation order and typed failure boundaries. It stages one owned prepared
C3D plan at the root command, then consumes it once inside the terminal scene.
The scene runs even without a selected object and now owns checked viewport
setup, conditional depth clear, Begin/End cleanup, world reset, and the opaque
scene tail. The software backend now executes the bounded branch-zero plan into
the indexed back buffer with persistent bindings and depth, then atomically
captures an owned indexed frame and palette at the terminal hook. The separate
native presentation executor now preserves sample-before-Flip invocation and
the windowed vblank/fallback sequence behind a typed adapter. The recovered
deferred-palette state and depth-8 commit are tested and integrated, including
runtime group mapping, both software caches, sentinel behavior, typed failure,
and exact scene/cleanup→palette→presentation order. The prepared pipeline sets
the selected root visibility latch after successful planning and clears all
six after every terminal scene attempt. Native host adaptation remains a
boundary. A bounded static search found no steady-frame windowed copy owner in
the shipped build, so a working portable windowed copy must be explicit host
policy rather than attributed legacy behavior.
The software compatibility path now has a production, callback-scoped root-menu
session assembler. It consumes an initialized startup display and verified
import, applies the recovered zero-RGB then pending `disk.pal` bootstrap,
retains every root resource and mutable frame state across repeated renders,
and tears down persistent sources before returning the backend. Native window,
event-loop, and host presentation integration remain separate later work.
The six optional root-menu C3D files now load through fixed slots and a bounded,
byte-preserving parser. All three counted groups expose proven framing: group
0's raw `u16` values; group 1's typed, borrowed 32/24-byte entry views; and
group 2's raw label fields plus opaque length-delimited blobs. The 32-byte view
decodes eight signed little-endian Q16.16 components in their recovered groups.
The 24-byte view exposes its three local entry ordinals, signed resource
ordinal, three byte-exact corner tuples, and two still-unknown scalars. Checked
borrowed resolvers now implement the proven group-0→group-1, entry24
`+2/+4/+6`→local entry32, and group-1-entry24→group-2 numeric joins, including
the latter's `-1` sentinel, without making reference validity a structural
parse requirement. A separate checked topology planner now partitions only
consecutive equal prepared selectors, deduplicates local entry ordinals in
first-use order, and emits three compact indices per source entry. It retains
borrowed typed source views rather than pretending to produce render-ready
vertices. Runtime affine conversion, selector/resource preparation, associated
side-vector materialization, and resource-derived mapping-coordinate scaling
are now recovered below; general/non-root material execution and
backend-integrated pixels remain unrecovered.
Group-2 records now also classify complete
`BM` signatures as opaque bitmap bytes and expose strictly framed, borrowed
`ANIM` entries with their resource ordinals, raw advance thresholds, and
separate legacy low-byte behavior. Bitmap pixels remain undecoded here because
the general embedded resource set is not limited to the standalone 8-bit
subset. A selected animation record can now resolve each frame ordinal against
the same file's group-2 table through an exact-size borrowed iterator; an
invalid frame remains a typed result and does not hide later frames.
For the root-only corpus-backed subset, all six objects of either visual variant
can now prepare into an owned fixed-slot resource set. Every embedded bitmap is
strictly decoded while preserving source indices and its full embedded palette;
the exact mode-2 path installs no surface color key. Bounded-label/dimensions/pixels
matches share arena-scoped stable prepared IDs, entry24 selectors retain source
order and `-1` remains an explicit missing selector, and one bad optional object
rolls back only its new resources before later slots continue. Palette
attachment and backend upload remain boundaries for alternate hardware paths;
the software root path retains its sampled bindings directly. The prepared resource
also retains the raw low words of its originating DIB dimensions because the
legacy surface-layout path consumes those words rather than normalized decoded
extents.
Prepared selectors now feed the checked consecutive-run topology planner through
a combined constructor tied to the exact borrowed asset set. The resulting
fixed-slot plans preserve group order, source views, missing selectors, compact
first-use vertex ordinals, and preparation diagnostics without exposing an
unsafe arbitrary source/preparation join. Group-0 references now retain their
owning record and checked group-1 target, and the pre-scale mode-2 materializer
reproduces wrapping Q16 affine arithmetic, f32 field layout, the persistent
pass-through latch, opaque pre-mutation side vectors, source-order last-writer
corner mutation, missing selectors, and batch compaction. All reviewed root
records force pass-through. Per-slot loader state keeps the unresolved tuple
gate explicit. A second materializer derives the legacy surface layout from the
first interned resource occurrence, including wrapping width alignment,
quarter/half gates, and asymmetric square expansion. It applies vertical then
horizontal mapping-coordinate factors with one f32 store, shares first-resource
claims by source vertex ordinal across selector runs, preserves same-entry
duplicate multiplication, and only then compacts batches. The exact root corpus
has square resources and therefore takes the proven zero-padding/no-multiply
case under normal or quarter preparation. The software branch-zero backend now
owns sampled bindings and active-palette composition; alternate material
profiles and the unresolved tuple-source gate remain C3D boundaries.
The root transform oracle is now portable and deterministic. A source-owned
quarter-wave table reconstructs the exact 4,096-entry legacy trig table, while
square-root values use equivalent integer arithmetic. The fixed-point row
normalizer preserves wrapping sums, low-word products, signed shifts, the
complete-raw-angle zero branch, and the distinction between raw angles `0` and
`0x1000`. Root world matrices retain the recovered Q16 translation and convert
to exact f32 words; identity view, frontend projection, and checked viewport
words are available without a platform graphics dependency. The software root
path now consumes them through scene traversal, resource binding, rasterization,
and indexed back-buffer composition; other renderer paths remain separate.
Topology and both materialized runtime stages now also carry the same opaque,
unforgeable prepared-arena provenance. The planner can therefore reject data
mixed across independent preparations even when no concrete resource ID is
available to expose the mismatch.
The root-only frame planner now performs that join transactionally. It checks
the exact one-level root shape, resource selectors, compact batch payloads,
viewport, slot presence, variant, and provenance before changing an angle, then
owns source-ordered submission snapshots and the exact recovered transform and
numeric draw words. Concrete software binding, depth/scene execution, the pixel
oracle, and a headless terminal capture are now joined. The selected one-frame
visibility latch is now set transactionally and all six root latches are
cleared after the scene attempt. The depth-gated deferred-palette commit now
runs between that cleanup and presentation. Native presentation adaptation
remains next.
Prepared resources now map once into an arena-scoped opaque binding catalog.
The root batch executor consumes a plan, preflights the complete catalog join,
sets world state, and preserves the recovered resource-binding and persistent
selector-cache order across source batches and frames. Branch-specific
material/texture work remains inside the opaque backend binding. Bindings are
released in reverse order, and external render paths can explicitly invalidate
the cache. The software backend implements the bounded branch-zero binding and
headless frame capture and visibility-latch cleanup; native presentation
adaptation, alternate profiles, and a portable GPU implementation remain
separate.
The championship-car path now preflights a single-use actor plan against the
exact frontend binding catalog before any scene effect, then executes the
shared terminal C3D bracket with actor-scoped worlds, resource/default-zero
selector transitions, and Type-2 draw commands. The full championship terminal
owner now preserves inline callback order, coordinates root/car binding-cache
ownership, clears all 20 frontend visibility latches, commits the requested
palette, and presents last. Static recovery now separates the process-global
optional Type-2 word-5 pre-draw mutation from caller flag `0x08`, which affects
only a different world/spatial renderer in resolved code. A pure owned-copy
mutation contract models the retained gate, thresholds, distance/center tuple,
fixed truncating x87 qword conversion, and exact fixed-square-root lookup.
Each car frame now prepares fresh owned Type-2 words before terminal effects,
submits them after the recovered selector-binding decision even on cache hits,
routes the active mesh's exact all-`-0x10000` origin sentinel to the per-vertex
distance arm, then conditionally overwrites word-4 RGB while preserving alpha.
Frame planning records the renderer's list-head RGB owner for each sibling list;
the standalone session requires explicit source-ordered per-car actor tables
because it cannot inherit arbitrary process state. Count, ownership, and
profile/state disagreement are rejected before effects. The software backend
admits all four word-5/actor-RGB gate combinations for the otherwise identical
unified-indexed COPY/no-blend profile, copies texture indices directly, and keeps
missing selectors distinct as reviewed-car index zero. A public synthetic
asset-to-scene test pins resource/default/resource execution and exact indexed
color/depth output. Car-present scenes now invoke a backend-specific effect-free
preflight before any terminal pixel or state effect; an end-to-end software
car/palette/presentation test renders the car, commits a discriminating group-4
request, and captures the same indices under the new palette. A callback-scoped
software championship session now loads and retains all 14 car topology/runtime
pairs, explicit raster-profile provenance, compact car/FCHE palette layout,
shared bindings, and frame state; synthetic and reviewed-import tests cover
hidden-to-visible rendering, car switching, Next, presentation, and teardown.
The original device branch, alpha, word-5 mutation, and actor-RGB gates are
independent retained inputs. The alternate branch now has exact 16/24/32
selection priority and a bounded canonical-RGB MODULATE oracle, while its
runtime texture descriptors and framebuffer masks now have exact raw retention,
candidate classification, retained non-alpha selection, and separate role-safe
source-owned mask utilities. Canonical RGB can be converted into logical masked
framebuffer words without asserting byte order or pitch. A nominal source-owned
conversion stage now retains Palette8 storage or materializes RGB555/RGB565
logical words before the alternate oracle filters and modulates them. Driver
texture `Load` equivalence remains separate; a terminal oracle now packs only
depth-passing results through independent logical framebuffer masks and leaves
uncovered words unchanged. Native surface layout, effective filter, dithering,
alpha pixels, full-session integration, and presentation remain separate. A
standalone headless split backend now owns the logical target/depth lifecycle,
transactionally retains converted bindings, preflights every resolved batch
before effects, validates retained-cache coherence, and executes repeated
frames. Native layout, effective filter, dithering, alpha, indexed 2D
composition, alternate-session ownership, and presentation remain open. A
source-owned bridge can now expand a completed indexed frame through an
explicit palette into that logical target without replaying keyed/clipped 2D
work. It remains a deterministic integration oracle rather than a substitute
for source-by-source conversion. Focused static evidence now establishes the
ordinary `0x81` 8-bit-BMP path at a 16-bit destination: each source uses its
own embedded palette, discriminator byte `5` selects RGB555 while every other
value selects RGB565, the complete aligned stored rows are converted, and the
source key is packed embedded-palette entry zero. A tested nominal
`ordinary_bitmap_rgb16` implementation now preserves that complete logical
result and rejects malformed source state before returning output. DirectDraw
stretch, active-device format selection, and full source-ordered session
integration remain open. Matching-format fast opaque/keyed logical blits now
have effect-free preflight, bit-exact word copy, nonzero packed-key handling,
aligned-row bounds, and owner-scoped inactive-backend execution. Source-ordered
alternate-session integration remains separate. Alternate fonts are explicitly
separate: their initialized path prepares a `0x90` source, may invoke driver
`Load`, and queues a colored primitive. The exact no-driver-`Load` ARGB4444
decoder subset now has one persistent 16-style owner retaining aligned rows,
palette provenance, parsed glyph metadata, literal-zero keying, and exact-black
alpha selection. Queue-consumer inspection also pins three 2,047-entry lanes,
52-byte records, ordered lane flushing, primitive submission versus terminal
bit-`0x40` fallback, and the championship tuple/fade arithmetic. The setup
model now retains the raw four-byte source tuple and signed Q16 fade, including
the recovered terminal/inactive/active row selection, and a source-neutral
font preflight emits lane-neutral semantic glyph-producer inputs in
command/glyph order against the persistent ARGB4444 owner. A separate semantic
router now owns three independent typed lanes, accepts exactly 2,047 records
per lane, accounts for later silent drops, retains FIFO order, and applies the
recovered byte-3 gate after acceptance. That gate preserves the caller byte
only when effective renderer mode is not 7 and the recovered alpha-texture
capability bit is present; otherwise it forces `0xff`. Session callers select
the lane explicitly because ordinary championship lane 2 remains a strong
inference. Native queue packing/flush execution, driver conversion, tuple
channel meanings, blend semantics, and final pixels remain unresolved
alongside native layout and dithering. R_INFO, the 11
unique logo assets, and all 15 Chequered frames now also have one transactional
27-source logical-RGB16 owner built directly from decoded user assets. Stable
identity/path diagnostics and per-bitmap palette provenance are pinned. One
shared ordered kernel now prepares either rich indexed payloads or a
lightweight alternate transcript from exact source extents, with tests proving
full public-command parity across car, gear, and Next cold/warm frames. The
alternate adapter derives aligned extents from the 27-source RGB16 pool and an
optional nominal converted Selection source without indexed uploads. A
two-pass alternate executor rejects stale cache snapshots, preflights every
supported Fast bitmap plus Selection Stretch before
effects, and composes them in transcript order while returning text, NoOp, and
other deferred boundaries as exact typed outcomes. Selection uses the recovered
literal-zero key/call geometry and an explicitly source-owned center-nearest
policy because the legacy DirectDraw sampling kernel is not present in the
executable. The cache commit proves only that bounded ordinary-bitmap pass;
the alternate terminal now adds complete common-scene/car-batch preflight,
coordinates transform/latch/palette state inline, and runs the selected-car or
empty Next scene after setup on the same target. It explicitly skips the
non-indexed palette commit while preserving the pending request. Standalone
alternate session ownership now builds this complete retained slice directly
from a verified user import without an indexed backend or uploaded sources. It
loads and converts Selection once, executes it through the named source-owned
Stretch policy, validates caller-explicit RGB and raster policies before
callback entry, and preserves target/depth, binding cache, preview/transform/
latch/route/palette state across repeated car and Next frames. The session now
also loads and owns the selected frontend table and all 16 ARGB4444 font
sources, prepares every non-deferred setup Text command before terminal
effects, routes that slice from initially empty lanes through caller-explicit
lane and resolved byte-3 policy, and attaches the result only to successful
outcomes. It does not yet merge later deferred info/next-preview producers.
The publication guarantee covers the returned value, not rollback of setup or
scene effects after a later failure. Static follow-up now also resolves the
native record's optional viewport, angle/pivot, lane, tuple, and terminal fields;
the current championship producer supplies zero angle/pivots and no viewport.
A backend-neutral flush plan orders accepted records by lanes 3, 2, 1 with exact
lane depths and per-record textured/fallback dispatch. Pure preflight now
resolves every source and constructs the bounded zero-transform/no-viewport
quad with exact corner order, depth, RHW, diffuse/specular carriers, and
renderer-mode UV rule; optional backend validation still completes before any
frame effect. Fresh owner evidence places the unconditional dispatch inside the
common scene after identity-world reset and before its opaque tail/EndScene,
including an empty Next scene. The alternate terminal executes that semantic
dispatch and reports per-terminal counts, but no font pixel backend exists yet.
Native record packing/count clearing, optional transforms/UV swaps, device
state, filtering, blending, fallback pixels, driver-exact Stretch comparison,
native presentation, and the other deferred pixels are the next integration
seams.

The workspace now also has its first application executable. `cmr-app`
requires a caller-selected imported runtime tree, embeds only reviewed profile
metadata, and renders one fixed official-EU English/Normal root frame through
the production software session. A versioned digest contract binds the complete
indexed plane and raw palette, while the CLI emits only path-free counters and
checksums. The application, existing video vertical test, and their failure
tests share one dependency-neutral generated import fixture. This completes
runtime-data discovery and the headless executable part of the vertical slice;
window creation, an event/input loop, SDL presentation, audio, and GPU work
remain. Before the SDL step, expose the completed software frame through a
narrow presenter consumer so the proven startup/session/render orchestration is
reused rather than copied.

Exit gate:

- clean build from source on the declared toolchain;
- importer succeeds for a recognized source and fails safely for wrong,
  incomplete, or modified sources;
- deterministic tests cover the vertical slice;
- a documented controlled comparison bounds remaining differences.

## Milestone 3 — playable compatibility baseline

Add subsystems in dependency order:

1. menus, profiles, saves, options, and localization;
2. resource decoding, renderer, audio mixer, and input mapping;
3. car and track scene loading;
4. fixed-step physics and collision;
5. race sequencing, timing, penalties, AI, co-driver, replay, and results;
6. multiplayer only after its original protocol and security boundary are known.

Current G03 recovery has isolated the signed force-candidate selector and the
pure arithmetic behind the nonzero control `+0x420` correction gate inside
`FUN_0040d810`. Both lookup-free candidate branches and the combined
lookup-dependent branch are reconstructed. The latter uses neutral
`signed_ratio_angle` and `derive_lookup_dependent_candidates` contracts with
the observed asymmetric zero, swap/sign, exact-ratio index-512 adjacent-zero,
and wrapping arithmetic. Zero gates precede validation: `(0,INT_MIN)` returns
`0`, `(INT_MIN,0)` returns `0x400`, and `INT_MIN` is rejected only when both
operands are nonzero. `0x400` denotes a
quarter-period and `0x1000` a full wrapping phase; this is not exposed as a
conventional atan2 API. `FUN_0048fba0` proves all five tables are generated
math rather than asset payloads, including arcsine `DAT_00831380` (canonical
hash `ddf0d95f...e02745b`) used by `FUN_0040fbe0`. The exact source-owned
`signed_arcsine_phase` contract preserves sign restoration, clamp/index
behavior, the exact-negative-one adjacent-zero sentinel, and safe `INT_MIN`
rejection. `apply_geometric_lane_postprocess` reconstructs the four-lane
two-pass qualification, legacy normalization, signed wrapping alignment bound,
shared scalar, and wrapping accumulator adds behind an atomic API whose only
fallible domain is the unsafe arcsine `INT_MIN` lookup.
`apply_lane_accumulation` now composes the subsequent `FUN_0040d810` tail in
its observed order: selected-scalar overwrite, gated first direction add,
second projection against that updated accumulator and optional add, then the
independent surface projection/add. The other `legacy_math` helpers centralize
the recovered consumers while mathematical `Fixed16::sqrt` stays distinct.
The upstream direction producer is now reconstructed as a neutral contract:
reject/normalize sources at physics `+0x550`, `+0x544`, and `+0x5d4` against
axis `+0x324`; form the fourth from the ordered raw cross of `+0x5d4` and
`+0x264` before rejection; pack A/B as `[P,P,S,S]`/`[R,R,T,T]`; preserve the
pre-mode A-valid flags; and apply caller-resolved Preserve, Exchange, or Rebuild
packing. Rebuild leaves C as the raw doubled-projection rejection and normalizes
only U, so exact unit/orthogonal claims are explicitly excluded. Eight focused
tests bring `vehicle_dynamics` to 71; `legacy_math` remains at 13. The
translational part of `FUN_0040a4a0` is now reconstructed separately as
`apply_translation_step`: cached prior speed scales old velocity into the
damping subtraction, acceleration advances velocity by `0x3333`, and position
adds the new velocity minus the Q16 `0x8000` half-delta. Nine focused tests,
including final-position wrapping, bring `vehicle_dynamics` to 80. This also
corrects the state map to position
`+0xc8..+0xd0`, velocity `+0xd4..+0xdc`, prior velocity `+0xe0..+0xe8`, and
cached prior speed `+0xec`; `+0x3cc..+0x3d4` is an additive
acceleration-like term and `+0x3d8..+0x3e0` belongs to the rotational chain.
The callback/global mode resolver, semantic vector/mode names, integration into
the simplified race-state harness, and a distinct suspension-damper identity
remain. The table-provenance inventory has now disproved the singular runtime
loader premise: two adjacent 120-word surface/material coefficient families are
PE-backed and can be extracted from a positively identified official-EU
executable, the gear/car values are emitted by fourteen compiled initializer
cases, and the `DAT_0050e170` family is BSS/runtime geometry state. The
source-owned `pe_surface` parser plus the profile-gated, hash-first
`extract-surface-tables` command establishes a safe local 960-byte extraction
under ignored `runtime-data/` without vendoring values. The fail-closed
`SurfaceTableStore` now validates the supported state generation, exact
reviewed-profile identity/digest and source metadata, and output path/size/hash
before owning both decoded families without retaining a filesystem path. Its
persistent-symlink checks assume a stable caller-owned directory during
`open`, not protection from concurrent adversarial mutation. A checked core
adapter now consumes the first `&[i32; 120]` family through the recovered
lane-scalar rule: it bounds-checks before override handling and preserves the
selected raw signed Q16.16 value. The adjacent second family remains
store-only and unknown; this milestone does not wire the store into the app or
session and does not conflate it with FFB `DAT_004edb70`, car initializer
`FUN_00404440`, or BSS `DAT_0050e170`. The compiled initializer now has a
payload-free schema contract: fourteen unsigned selectors share an exact
eight-state/twenty-three-control-word destination layout, invalid selectors
preserve those destinations, and a separate helper reconstructs the later
eight-slot reciprocal/copy family with signed division and zero handling. Nine
synthetic tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,104 while `vehicle_dynamics` remains 85.
No official tuning values are tracked. G03-P now completes the narrow
user-owned extraction boundary for those direct case words. The shared pure
PE32 parser proves the reviewed seed, unsigned dispatch, fourteen-entry jump
table, non-overlapping case bodies, and exact constant-store grammar before
returning all fourteen records. The metadata-only official profile and
`extract-compiled-car-initializer` command hash the bounded source before
parsing, then atomically publish the versioned 1,760-byte `CMRCCASE` container
and path-free state beneath an explicit ignored `runtime-data/` destination.
`CompiledInitializerStore` revalidates every identity/shape field, exact size
and hash, and owns the decoded records without retaining a path. G03-Q adds the
narrow `CompiledDirectCaseSet` core consumer: fixed array types prove per-record
word counts, while construction explicitly checks selector count and exact
neutral offset identity, copies all signed words in selector order, and feeds only the
existing unsigned direct-case selection contract. Two synthetic tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,106. This is not application/session/gameplay wiring and does
not extend the recovered behavior beyond the direct stores. G03-R recovers the
next bounded common-path step, official-EU `FUN_00404160`: it reads and rewrites
only control `+0x1d4..+0x1e8`, computes all five wrapping adjacent differences
before mutation, selects one of five Q16 scale/first-word-bias policies from the
low three option bits, then rebuilds the six words with signed arithmetic-shift
products and cumulative wrapping addition. The payload-free
`transform_compiled_control_run` and eight-word
`transform_compiled_control_family` adapter preserve the outer words and add
six synthetic tests, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,112. The signed config-record
lookup/domain remains outside that transform. G03-S recovers the preceding
`FUN_00404100` helper: after every valid or invalid direct-case selector has
joined the common path, it reads config-record byte `+0x95`, masks its low three
bits, and always writes center drive split `control+0x170` as Q16 `0x4000` for
mode `0`, `0x8000` for mode `1`, or `0xc000` for modes `2..7`. This field is
not a direct-case destination. The existing `FUN_0040d810` evidence consumes
it and its `0x10000-split` complement in both coast and driven front/rear
distribution. The total `compiled_center_split_q16` helper plus two tests,
including all 256 byte inputs, brings `cmr-core` to 1,114. The signed config
lookup/domain remains outside that helper. G03-T recovers `FUN_00407270` as a
separate 22-dword auxiliary control patch. Its exact ascending destinations are
`+0xd8,+0xdc,+0xe0,+0xe4,+0xe8,+0xec,+0xf0,+0xf4,+0xf8,+0xfc,+0x100`,
`+0x104,+0x108,+0x10c,+0x110,+0x118,+0x11c,+0x120,+0x124,+0x128,+0x12c`,
and `+0x13c`: seven policy immediates, nine common immediates, and six derived
words. A force bit bypasses config lookup; otherwise low-three-bit modes `1`,
`2`, and `0,3..7` choose policy one, policy two, and default. The derived words
use signed Q16 multiplication, signed `state+0x48 >> 3`, and three guarded
signed `2^32/x` reciprocals. `AuxControlConstants` keeps every withheld
function literal caller-owned; `derive_aux_control_patch` implements only the
payload-free policy/arithmetic and a typed atomic overflow. Six tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,120. The patch is disjoint from direct-case destinations. At
the G03-T boundary, a reviewed user-owned constants extractor/store, signed
config lookup/domain, full composition with the other initializer stages and later tail,
application/session/gameplay wiring, meanings/units, gameplay index invariants,
other editions, runtime geometry/BSS consumers, and full
`FUN_0040d810`/`FUN_0040a4a0` closure remain open.

G03-U completes that narrow user-owned auxiliary-constant extraction/storage
boundary. `cmr-formats::pe_aux_control_initializer` semantically decodes the
canonical official-EU `FUN_00407270` instruction and control-flow grammar rather
than embedding a normalized byte template, returning a neutral 38-word shape
(nine common words, two Q16 multipliers, and three seven-word/two-divisor
policies). Its independently versioned `CMRAUXC` v1 codec is exactly 184 bytes:
a 32-byte magic/version/count header followed by 38 signed little-endian words.
The exact-digest metadata-only official profile and explicit
`extract-aux-control-constants` command identify and hash the bounded user-owned
executable before parsing, then self-check and atomically publish fixed flat
data/state files beneath an explicit ignored `runtime-data/` destination.
`AuxControlConstantsStore` rejects mismatched identity/shape/hash, linked or
special files, truncation/trailing bytes, and malformed codecs before owning the
decoded words without retaining a path. The 149 format tests, 76 assets-library
tests, eight CLI tests, three audit tests, and opt-in ignored official smoke
cover the semantic decoder and storage boundary without tracking or exposing an
official value. A checked format/store-to-core adapter, safe signed config-record
resolver and domain, composition with the direct cases/center split/six-word
transform/auxiliary patch/later tail, semantics and units, application/session
wiring, and other editions remain open.

G03-V (`824acde`) adds the checked core ownership boundary for those
authenticated words.
`AuxControlConstantSet` accepts an `AuxControlConstantsStore`, uses fixed array
types to pin record cardinalities, verifies the exact format/core order of all
22 output, nine common, and seven policy offsets, and copies the complete
38-word signed shape unchanged into core-owned records. The value survives
dropping both the store and its backing root. Its narrow `derive` method only
delegates to `derive_aux_control_patch`, including that helper's typed reciprocal
overflow. Three synthetic tests cover cross-layer shape/order invariants, signed
ownership and every policy after drop, and overflow propagation, bringing
`cmr-core` to 1,123. The signed config-record resolver, composition with direct
cases, center split, six-word transform, later reciprocal/copy tail, application
or session/gameplay state, meanings, units, and other editions remain open.

G03-W (`f9e3b1f`) closes the unsafe shared option-lookup boundary without
pretending the surrounding configuration block is a homogeneous table. Static
evidence traces the authoritative `state+0x738` store through every resolved direct constructor:
ordinary construction supplies `0..=7`, while the alternate path supplies only
zero or one. All three helpers sign-extend that byte and use stride `0x9c` to
read raw options at record-relative `+0x93`, `+0x95`, and `+0x99`; the auxiliary
helper separately checks unindexed `config+0x26 & 2` to force its default. The
config pointer comes from the persistent root and the initialized block is
`0x6c4` bytes, but its persistence layout is heterogeneous: only slots zero and
one belong to the directly authored/persisted two-stride window, while later
helper-visible addresses overlap other copied regions. Thus eight is the bound
for every resolved explicit state constructor, not a homogeneous record count.
The derived `resolve_compiled_config_options` accepts a caller-owned byte view, rejects
negative and `>=8` signed slots, validates the highest required address before
reading, preserves all raw option bits for the existing arithmetic helpers, and
uses only the unindexed force bit. Five synthetic tests cover error precedence,
exact truncation boundaries, record selection without mutation, slot seven, and
force-flag addressing, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,128. Composition with direct
cases, center split, the six-word transform, auxiliary patch, and reciprocal
tail remains separate; config loading, application/session/gameplay wiring,
meanings, units, and other editions remain open.

G03-X (`f26520d`) composes those recovered stages while preserving the gaps established by
static dataflow. From the direct-case join to the first helper, the omitted
common prefix always adjusts direct control `+0x148`, can Q16-scale direct
control `+0x148/+0x15c` and all eight direct state words under config flags,
and derives state `+0x48/+0x4c`; it does not touch the
eight-word family `+0x1d0..+0x1ec`, center split `+0x170`, or auxiliary patch
region. The observed later sequence is center split, six-word family transform,
auxiliary patch, and the separate `FUN_00486090` write to state `+0x758`. The
also-omitted `0x406324..0x406459` interval then writes state `+0xec`; control
dwords `+0x144,+0x14c,+0x150,+0x154,+0x160,+0x174,+0x178,+0x17c`,
`+0x180,+0x184,+0x188,+0x18c,+0x1a8,+0x1b4,+0x408`; control byte `+0x440`;
and control word `+0x3e4`
before the reciprocal/copy tail. Its guarded reciprocal from `+0x15c` to
`+0x160` can fault first. `RecoveredCompiledStageEffects` therefore keeps the raw
direct-case outcome, center scalar, auxiliary patch, and four post-tail family
arrays separate rather than inventing a complete state/control snapshot.
At G03-X, `compose_recovered_compiled_stage_effects` resolved the shared config
once, accepted caller-supplied post-prefix `state_word_48`, and validated in
config-before-aux-before-family order only among represented stages. Typed
failure returned no partial bundle, an explicit safe reconstruction policy
rather than shipped in-place fault semantics; success did not prove the shipped
full path reached or published the tail. Five synthetic tests covered a selected
case, invalid-selector common
effects, exact destination relationships, option routing and tail output, and
typed error precedence, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,133. The common prefix,
`FUN_00486090`, the post-helper interval, merged object application,
application/session/gameplay wiring,
meanings/units, and other editions remain open.

G03-Y (`414e90f`) supersedes the G03-X caller-supplied-prefix interface. Static
instruction verification pins exact interval `[0x4060d3,0x4062ba)`: wrapped
`control+0x148-0x51e`; optional raw-config-`+0x25` bit-`0x02` Q16 stores to
`+0x15c` and adjusted `+0x148`; optional bit-`0x04` Q16 halving of all eight
direct state words; wrapped `state+0x48=control+0x140+0x780000`; and guarded
signed `2^32/+0x48` into state `+0x4c`. The exact-write patch preserves absent
conditional stores as `None`; divisors `-1`, `1`, and `2` return a typed atomic
error. This no-result error boundary is reconstruction policy because the
shipped in-place path had already written earlier destinations before `IDIV`.
The config resolver now returns raw unindexed `+0x25`, and the stage composition
derives the prefix for selected and invalid-selector-preserved words, routes its
derived `+0x48` into the auxiliary helper, and reports represented failures in
config-before-prefix-before-aux-before-family order. Eight new synthetic tests
plus strengthened existing composition tests cover the exact write set,
individual and combined flags, unrelated bits, signed/wrapping arithmetic,
fault boundaries, resolver addressing, invalid selectors, destination
disjointness, and precedence, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,141.
`FUN_00486090`, interval `0x406324..0x406459`, complete object application,
runtime reachability, meanings/units, other editions, and application wiring
remain open.

G03-Z (`bcda59c`) reconstructs and integrates the exact no-call interval
`[0x406324,0x40645f)`. A mixed-width exact-write patch carries fifteen control
dwords, state dword `+0xec`, control byte `+0x440`, and control word `+0x3e4`.
It consumes effective post-prefix control `+0x148/+0x15c`; `+0x14c` copies the
former and `+0x160` is zero-to-`-1` or signed `2^32/+0x15c`. Divisors
`-1,1,2` return a typed atomic error, unlike the shipped in-place path where
eight earlier writes are already visible. Composition selects scaled or raw
`+0x15c` correctly and validates represented stages
config-before-prefix-before-aux-before-post-helper-before-family. Five new
tests plus strengthened existing composition tests cover the complete schema,
widths, values, signed boundaries, routing, disjointness, invalid selectors,
and precedence, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,146. The preceding `FUN_00486090`
state `+0x758` effect, complete object application, semantics/units, runtime
reachability, application wiring, and other editions remain open.

G03-AA reconstructs `FUN_00486090` plus its initializer caller selection while
keeping the fixed-address table caller-owned. Context zero and the gated
selection-byte region choose `-1`; other bytes select `5*row+column`, reaching
indices `0..=13,15..=18`. The helper stores non-sentinel dwords verbatim to
state `+0x758`; `-1` resolves checked record-relative config `+0x91 & 7`.
Composition conditionally reads unindexed config `+0x6c0`, returns the state
effect separately, and validates config-before-prefix-before-aux-before-state-
selection-before-post-helper-before-family. Four new tests plus strengthened
tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,150. Static review found the second direct caller at
`0x46d113` and a `+0x738` save/restore store, narrowing the older claim to the
initializer being the only observed originating constructor assignment. Table
values/extent, semantic meanings, generic second-caller provenance, runtime
reachability, complete object application, wiring, and other editions remain
open.

G03-AB reconstructs the bounded immediate post-family no-call interval
`[0x406655,0x4066dd)`. It signed-Q16 multiplies effective post-prefix control
`+0x15c` by reciprocal-family slot 6 (`+0x208`), keeps product bits 16..47 as
`p`, and uses arithmetic `d=p>>2`. Control `+0x164` receives `-1` when `d` is
zero or signed `2^32/d`; exact quotient-fault divisors `-1,1,2` become a typed
safe error. The shipped path writes `+0x164` first, then reloads and recomputes
the product before writing `p` to `+0x168`. The pure helper returns the pair
atomically under stable-memory assumptions, without claiming whole-initializer
atomicity or concurrency equivalence. Composition runs after family success and
uses `control_families.reciprocal[6]`, extending represented failure order with
the product pair last. Four new tests plus strengthened composition tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,154. Field semantics, complete writers/consumers, runtime
reachability, merged object application, application wiring, and other editions
remain open.

G03-AC maps the remaining instruction-aligned initializer suffix
`[0x4066dd,0x407231)` into bounded arithmetic, reset, call, pointer-backed,
RNG, snapshot, and terminal regions; `0x406d00` is explicitly rejected as a
slice boundary because it bisects an instruction. The first recovered slice,
`[0x4066dd,0x406831)`, derives state `+0x44` from the wrapping Q16 square sum of
arithmetic-halved effective `+0x20/+0x24/+0x28` via the existing exact
`sqrt_q16`, then writes raw integer seeds `[1,2,1]` at `+0x50/+0x54/+0x58`
or `[2,4,2]` when unindexed config `+0x25 & 0x04` is set. Composition routes
prefix-scaled or raw selected/prior state words into the separate effect. Three
new tests plus strengthened schema/composition coverage bring `cmr-core` to
1,157. The sequential reciprocal trio beginning at `0x406831`, later calls,
pointer-backed writes, resets, RNG, snapshot, terminal blocks, semantic names,
runtime reachability, complete object application, and other editions remain
open.

G03-AD reconstructs the sequential state reciprocal interval
`[0x406831,0x4068dc)`. Effective post-prefix state `+0x20/+0x24/+0x28`
produces `+0x38/+0x3c/+0x40` in order through zero-to-`-1` or signed
`2^32/input`; exact fault divisors are `-1,1,2`. The typed safe error records
the failing index/divisor and earlier stores the shipped in-place sequence had
already published, while the pure aggregate returns no effect. Composition
runs the trio after suffix defaults and ProductPair. Three new tests plus
strengthened schema/composition coverage bring `cmr-core` to 1,160. The next
control-clear loop and all later mapped suffix regions remain open.

G03-AE reconstructs the control-clear loop `[0x4068dc,0x4068ff)`. The
containing path carries zero in `EDI`; eight iterations publish sixteen dword
zeros as interleaved pairs across control `+0x31c..+0x338` and
`+0x33c..+0x358`. The pure effect preserves observed store order and is added
to stage composition only after reciprocal-trio success. One new focused test
plus strengthened schema and composition coverage bring `cmr-core` to 1,161.
The repeatedly loaded native control pointer, partial memory-fault visibility,
field meanings, and the half/corner state region from `0x4068ff` remain open.

G03-AF corrects two provisional suffix boundaries and reconstructs the complete
direct object-write effect of no-call interval `[0x4068ff,0x406aaf)`. Effective
state `+0x20/+0x24/+0x28` is arithmetic-halved and expanded into 27 ordered
half/sign dwords. The overlapping reset setup then clears ten control dwords
and four state u16s while raw unindexed config `+0x26 & 0x02` selects four state
dwords as zero or `-0x8000`. Three new focused tests plus strengthened resolver,
schema, and composition coverage bring `cmr-core` to 1,164. Native pointer/config
rebinding, partial publication, the outgoing `ESI=0`/`EBX=2` handoff, meanings,
and the call-bearing region beginning at `0x406aaf` remain open.

G03-AG maps `[0x406aaf,0x406b00)` as an ordered call-spine contract:
state-basis call, eight control-u16 clears, three global seeds, eight-lane
mutation call, then global state transform. Because every call materially
mutates state, the direct local effects are intentionally not appended to the
composed initializer. One focused test brings `cmr-core` to 1,165. Recovery of
`FUN_00409c10` with transitive `FUN_00418120` is the next gate.

G03-AH reconstructs `FUN_00409c10` with its sole helper `FUN_00418120` as a
fixed-shape stable-snapshot contract. The pair derives four primary sign vectors
and four center reflections in state `+0xfc..+0x158`; the reusable helper adjusts
only the primaries from two vectors and three scalars. Six focused tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,171. Native progressive matrix reads, aliases/store prefixes,
and call-spine integration remain open while `FUN_00419a40`/`FUN_00446c40` and
`FUN_00408fe0` are unresolved.

G03-AI separates the exact caller-side portion of `FUN_00419a40` from its
geometry-dependent `FUN_00446c40` dispatcher. Eight per-lane post-dispatch snapshots
feed tested gate/drive, type-switch, first-four subtraction, accumulator/latch,
and per-lane config-override rules. Six focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,177.
The dispatcher and its global geometry/spatial tables remain an injected open
boundary, so this aggregate is not yet composed into the initializer.

G03-AJ reconstructs the `FUN_00446c40` wrapper state machine behind a narrow
geometry-provider interface. The typed controller preserves redundant negative
handle normalization, validate/search/build routing, fallback behavior, ordered
handle-write prefixes, provider-owned output/type writes, and failure phase.
Three focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,180. The provider's transitive
geometry, tables, arithmetic faults, and partial internal writes remain open.

G03-AK1 reconstructs `FUN_00446fa0` arithmetic over decoded caller-owned
triangle data. It pins type/raw-vector/final-vector store order, exact Q16
normalization and cross orientation, fallback behavior, and a typed final
division overflow carrying already-published effects. Five focused tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,185. Raw record/vector lookup and spatial search remain open.

G03-AK2 reconstructs the inner ordered candidate chooser `FUN_00447540` over
an explicit signed count and bounded handle list. It preserves lazy
validate/decode gating, wrapped signed-average scoring, first-winner and strict
replacement behavior, tie stability, and the sole final handle publication.
Five focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,190. The outer `FUN_004473f0` spatial
hierarchy/list-offset decoder and raw geometry-table access remain open.

G03-AK3 reconstructs outer hierarchy resolver `FUN_004473f0` over decoded
eight-byte cell views. Wrapping origin subtraction, signed coarse bounds,
row-major indexing, five two-bit refinements, exact sentinel/depth behavior,
and lazy reached-cell failures are covered by four focused tests, bringing
`cmr-core` to 1,194. Candidate-pool adaptation, raw table decoding, and
composition into the dispatcher provider remain open.

G03-AK4 composes the decoded hierarchy, candidate-word pool, and AK2 chooser
without eager full-range validation. Three focused tests preserve hierarchy,
pool-start, provider, and per-ordinal list-error precedence, bringing
`cmr-core` to 1,197. Raw official table acquisition and a concrete geometry
provider that also validates/decodes/builds remain open.

G03-AK5 reconstructs the post-decode `FUN_00446d00` X/Z validator with signed
inclusive bounds and exact wrapping, independently projected Q16 edge scores.
Six focused tests cover orientation, edges, degeneracy, bounds, rounding, and
overflow, bringing `cmr-core` to 1,203. Raw record/vertex decoding and concrete
provider integration remain open.

G03-AK6 reconstructs exact `FUN_00446e80` record/vertex lookup as a safe
type-free decoder with ordered bounds errors. Three focused tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,206.

G03-AK7 composes the decoded hierarchy, candidate pool, record/vertex tables,
validator, chooser, and builder into a concrete stable-table geometry provider.
The build performs its checked type +6 read only after a fresh vertex decode;
nested failures retain the wrapper/search/build phase and publication prefix.
Five focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,211. Raw official table acquisition,
native rebinding/alias/fault behavior, and the eight-lane application remain
open.

G03-AK8 binds that provider boundary to the eight iterations of
`FUN_00419a40`. `execute_compiled_eight_lanes` performs each dispatch and its
caller postprocess before advancing, applies provider type/vector writes before
the post-call type branch, and reloads config through a late fallible provider.
Typed dispatch/config failures retain the exact reconstructed state prefix and
completed-lane trace at the represented wrapper/caller boundary; provider-
internal partial publication remains in the nested typed error. Four focused
tests, including a concrete eight-provider decoded-table run, bring `cmr-core`
to 1,215. Raw official table acquisition, native pointer aliases/rebinding/
machine-fault prefixes, `FUN_00408fe0`, and full call-spine composition remain
open.

G03-AK9 resolves the table provenance and implements the decoded format
boundary: every geometry view consumed by AK3-AK8 comes from the decoded
payload of the stage's `.hpc` sidecar, loaded through the existing CMPR path.
`cmr-formats::hpc::parse_hpc` preserves reserved words and safely validates the
five real hierarchy arrays, vertices, records, candidate handles, dimensions,
and every reachable relationship. A core adapter feeds the parsed snapshot to
the decoded provider while replacing the native sixth-slot vertex-pointer alias
with an unreachable empty slice. The decoded format also retains any opaque
tail the unchecked native view constructor leaves unread. Eight synthetic
tests plus an opt-in owned-media corpus test bring `cmr-formats` to 158 tests;
`cmr-core` remains at 1,215.
G03-AK10 adds the authenticated runtime owner without changing the recovered
14-section render bundle. `StageCompiledGeometry::load` accepts an explicit
profile-relative stage base, resolves and re-verifies its `.hpc` through the
existing `AssetStore`, parses it into an owned snapshot, and exposes eight
providers borrowing that same immutable payload. Seven focused tests cover raw
and CMPR imports, case-normalized lookup, owned lifetime, tamper-before-parse
precedence, authenticated malformed payloads, unsafe/missing identities,
path-free parser diagnostics, and a complete eight-lane execution. `cmr-core` reaches
1,222 tests. No new extractor or media profile is needed: the reviewed generic
profile already authenticates all 76 installed-EU `.hpc` files.
Live application identity/input wiring, the adjacent `.srf`/`.shp` sidecars,
`FUN_00408fe0`, native pointer fault/rebinding behavior, and full call-spine
composition remain open.

G03-AK11 reconstructs post-lane `FUN_00408fe0` over a stable snapshot. Signed
wrapping pseudo-absolute selector words choose one of three four-point quads
with exact B-then-A-then-C tie priority. Two Q16 face vectors are oriented to a
nonnegative second component and normalized; the first is published, then its
wrapping sum with the second is normalized and overwrites the same output.
`derive_compiled_post_lane_global_normal` exposes both publication layers and
the ignored raw final square-sum return. Five focused tests bring `cmr-core` to
1,227. Native global-pointer rebinding/fault prefixes and composition after the
fallible eight-lane executor remain open.

G03-AK12 adds that orchestration boundary. `execute_compiled_eight_lanes_then`
invokes one typed post stage only after all eight lanes and their late config
reads succeed. Lane/config failure skips it; post failure retains the complete
eight-lane success and leaves progressive post publication in the adapter's
typed error. `CompiledPostLaneGlobalNormal` is the concrete AK11 adapter and
feeds source vectors plus final post-config lane words. Five focused tests
bring `cmr-core` to 1,232. Native pointer rebinding/fault prefixes and the
remaining caller continuation after `0x406b00` remain open.

G03-AK13 reconstructs the call-free post-normal basis rebuild at
`FUN_00404440 [0x406b00,0x406e30)`. The pure contract dots the AK11 final
vector with the prior `+0x258` vector using wrapping Q16 arithmetic, removes
that projection, normalizes through the generated sqrt table, and takes the
cross in exact `u × n` order. The verbatim AK11 vector is stored at `+0x264`
(superseding old selector word `+0x268`), then the rebuilt row at `+0x258`,
then the cross row at `+0x270`; the old rows are write-only.
`CompiledPostLaneBasis` consumes the AK11 final publication only after AK8
success. Ten focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,242. The following
`[0x406e30,0x406e9a)` pointer publication, destination aliases, rebinding, and
progressive fault prefixes remain open.

G03-AK14 reconstructs that pointer publication. `publish_compiled_post_lane_basis`
writes the rebuilt prior row, the verbatim AK11 row, and the cross row into an
injected destination at strides `+0x00/+0x10/+0x20`, three dwords each,
preserving the padding dwords. `CompiledPostLanePublishedBasis` composes AK11,
AK13, and publication through the AK12 barrier. The following call to the
already reconstructed `FUN_00409c10(state)` is documented; `0x406ea5` begins
the separate state-adjustment phase. Three focused tests bring `cmr-core` to
1,245. Destination aliases, pointer rebinding, and progressive fault prefixes
remain open.

G03-AK15 opens that adjustment phase. `derive_compiled_state_adjustment_cc`
reproduces the wrapping accumulation `state+0xcc += state+0x2e4 - state+0x100`,
and `publish_compiled_state_adjustment` writes `+0xc8`, the updated `+0xcc`,
and `+0xd0` at destination `+0x30/+0x34/+0x38`, preserving the following
dword. The subsequent call order is pinned as `FUN_00492770(state+8,
state+0xc8)`, `FUN_00409c10(state)`, `FUN_004126b0()`; only `FUN_00409c10` is
already reconstructed. Two focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,247. The other
two callees and destination alias/fault behavior remain open.

G03-AK16 reconstructs the following reset block: six contiguous state dwords
zeroed at `+0x3cc..+0x3e0`, then `+0xbc = 0`, `+0xc0 = 0x10000`, `+0xc4 = 0`.
The descending control loop clears exactly eight dwords at `0x3b0..0x3cc` in
native order. `derive_compiled_adjustment_reset` pins the constant effects.
Two focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,249. The config-dependent flag bytes,
copy loops, and final state writes remain open.

G03-AK17 reconstructs the config-selected control flag (`+0x3f0` is `2` when
config bit `0x10` is clear, else `1`) and the surrounding constant writes:
control dwords `+0x3f4/+0x3f8/+0x3fc/+0x3ec` and bytes `+0x43c/+0x43d/+0x43e`
zeroed, control `+0x37c = -0x4ccc` and `+0x41c = 0`, state dwords
`+0x684/+0x610/+0x678/+0x6e4` and u16 words `+0x60c/+0x614` zeroed, and three
dwords copied from `+0x258` to `+0x5d4`. Two focused tests bring `cmr-core` to
1,251. The `+0x6f8` conditional flag and the `+0x6e8/+0x6ec` words remain open.

G03-AK18 reconstructs the conditional flags: `+0x6f8` is `1` when
`FUN_0046b240()` returns `8` or `FUN_0048d2d0()` returns nonzero, with the
second callee short-circuited, then `+0x6f0 = 1`. The `+0x6e8/+0x6ec` words
are zero when `DAT_00550c08 == 2` or `DAT_00d3ca88 != 0`; otherwise `+0x6e8 =
1` and `+0x6ec` is the signed remainder of the RNG draw by two times ten plus
`0xd`, reachable values `3`, `13`, and `23`. Two focused tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,253. The copy loops and final state writes remain open.

G03-AK19 closes the direct effects of `FUN_00404440`: copy loops move 24
dwords from `+0xfc` to `+0x1bc` and 9 dwords from `+0x258` down to `+0x21c`;
then `+0x240` receives `+0xc8/+0xcc/+0xd0` and `+0x24c` receives the AK11
final vector. State bytes `+0x74d/+0x74e` and control byte `+0x428` are
zeroed, control `+0x420 = 1`, `DAT_0050c5fc = ((~config_25 & 1) << 0xf) |
0x1999`, and `FUN_0046eda0()` runs only when `DAT_00d3ca88 != 0`. Three
focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,255. The remaining callees and full
call-spine composition remain open.

G03-AK20 reconstructs `FUN_0048d2d0`: false at detail `8`; otherwise weather
`3`/`4` yields `DAT_00592efc != 1`, weather `5` yields true, and every other
input yields false. The weather and intensity getters are evaluated only on
their native short-circuit paths. `FUN_0046b240` is confirmed as the
`DAT_00592f00` getter and `FUN_004cfac0` as the already reconstructed LCG. One
focused test brings `cmr-core` to 1,256. The `FUN_00492770` switch stores
remain open.

G03-AK21 reconstructs `FUN_00492770`: the switch at `param_1+0x180` stores the
three source dwords at `+0xc4/+0xc8/+0xcc` for cases `0` and `3`, adds stores
at `+0x10/+0x14/+0x18` for cases `1` and `2`, and stores no vector otherwise.
Every path zeroes `param_1+0x188` and calls `FUN_00492050`. One focused test
brings `cmr-core` to 1,257. `FUN_00492050` remains unreconstructed; the
`FUN_004126b0` lane threshold scan follows.

G03-AK22 reconstructs `FUN_004126b0`: starting from `+0x742 = 0` and
`+0x743 = 1`, it scans lanes `7` down to `0` with the strict signed test
`lane_word + 0x1999 < source_y` (wrapping addition). Passing lanes set their
`+0x73a` flags; failing lanes clear them and `+0x743`, append their indices at
`+0x744 + count`, and increment `+0x742`. Two focused tests bring `cmr-core`
to 1,259. The `FUN_0046eda0` global copy gate follows.

G03-AK23 reconstructs `FUN_0046eda0`: only when `DAT_00550c08 == 1`, it copies
`0x119` dwords from `DAT_005fffc8` to `DAT_0060042c` and `0x1da` dwords from
`DAT_00700300` to `DAT_00700a68`. Each destination begins immediately after
its source range, so the blocks never overlap. One focused test brings
`cmr-core` to 1,260. The copied global tables are runtime data. All direct
effects and callees of the initializer are now contracted; full call-spine
composition follows.

G03-AK24 reconstructs `FUN_00492050`: it follows the node link at `+0x8` and
sets the `+0x170` flag to `1` on every node until the null link, doing nothing
for a null initial pointer. `apply_compiled_92050` reproduces the effect over
an injected flag slice. One focused test brings `cmr-core` to 1,261.

G03-AK25 composes the post-lane spine in native order.
`execute_compiled_spine_post` runs the eight-lane executor (aborting on
failure), AK11, AK13, the AK14 publication, the adjustment and its
publication, `FUN_00492770`, the lane thresholds, the reset, the control
flags, the conditional flags and RNG word, the copies, `DAT_0050c5fc`, and the
final call gate, all through the pure callee contracts. Two focused tests
bring `cmr-core` to 1,263. Progressive faults, pointer rebinding, and the
early initializer stages remain open.

G03-AK26 completes the composition. `compose_compiled_initializer` chains the
early post-dispatch stages, the basis transform, the call-spine locals, and
the eight-lane/post-lane spine into one typed result. An early failure returns
before any lane runs; a lane failure aborts before the post-lane spine. Three
focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,266. The exact native dataflow into the
injected inputs remains a separate boundary; wiring the composition to real
imported stage and car/config inputs is next.

G03-AK27 proves the composed initializer over an authenticated snapshot: a
CMPR-wrapped reviewed `.hpc` loads through `StageCompiledGeometry` and drives
`compose_compiled_initializer` to completion with the reviewed synthetic
config. All eight lanes finish with the decoded record type and built output
vector, and the AK11 normal, AK13 basis, and copies are independently
re-derived from the final lane words. One focused test brings `cmr-core` to
1,267. The car config record remains a reviewed synthetic fixture; recovering
its car-data source and live stage identity is next.

G03 continues into the per-wheel force pass. The slip candidate is
`dot * 4 - wheel_speed` (wrapping), the slip force is
`qmul(slip, DAT_0050c600) * 4` clamped symmetrically to the per-wheel limit at
`ctl+0x378`, and the downshift is `5` with the per-wheel flag set, else `2`
when both config dwords are zero, else `3`. `cmr-core::drivetrain` gains
`wheel_slip_candidate`, `slip_sign_disagreement`, `clamp_wheel_slip_force`,
and `wheel_slip_shift`. Four focused tests bring `cmr-core` to 1,271. The
slip-force gate, per-wheel drive application, and wheel-speed integration
remain open.

G03 next recovers the per-wheel drive application (split and wheel constant
added on negative speed, unchanged at zero, subtracted on positive), the slip
gate (front always, rear only without handbrake or with sign disagreement),
the wheel-speed integration `speed + qmul(force, DAT_0050c5c0)`, and the
zeroing gate (sign flip when `gear == 0`, `ctl+0x40c != 0`, or `ctl+0x158`
equals the per-wheel constant; otherwise a gear-ratio sign mismatch).
`cmr-core::drivetrain` gains `apply_wheel_drive`, `apply_wheel_slip`,
`integrate_wheel_speed`, and `gate_wheel_speed`. Four focused tests bring
`cmr-core` to 1,275. The second per-wheel force loop remains open.

Exit gate:

- a complete offline race can be started, driven, finished, saved, and replayed
  using user-imported data;
- compatibility checks cover deterministic state traces, file round trips, and
  representative rendered/audio outputs with documented tolerances;
- all required obligations for that path are closed or explicitly unsupported.

## Milestone 4 — modern platform backends

Replace legacy boundaries one at a time while retaining the compatibility lane:

| Legacy boundary | Candidate modern backend |
| --- | --- |
| DirectDraw / GDI | First native slice: software oracle presented by SDL_Renderer; provisional native 3D: wgpu, benchmarked against SDL_GPU before lock-in |
| DirectInput / WinMM joystick | Provisional: SDL3 keyboard/joystick; optional mapped gamepad after compatibility |
| QMixer / WinMM audio | Provisional: SDL3 audio with a reconstruction-owned mixer |
| Win32 timing/window loop | Provisional: SDL3 events plus a monotonic host clock |
| DirectPlay | explicitly designed transport after protocol recovery |
| Registry/install paths | portable configuration and data discovery |

The rationale, alternatives, compatibility constraints, and benchmark gates are
tracked in [`MODERN_BACKEND_RESEARCH.md`](MODERN_BACKEND_RESEARCH.md). SDL3 is
the selected host-layer direction; SDL_Renderer is only the first compatibility
presenter, not a mandate that native 3D use SDL_GPU.

Phase 4A is complete: `cmr-video-wgpu` and the Vulkan-only
`cmr-video-sdl-gpu` pass the same exact indexed-palette readback contract on the
locally available discrete NVIDIA and integrated AMD adapters. This establishes
the presentation primitive but does not select a winner. Phase 4B must feed
both candidates the same raw recovered C3D draw packets and benchmark a
caller-selected imported stage before I08 can complete or I09 can begin.

The Phase 4B correctness slice is also complete for the bounded opaque-COPY
stage profile: both candidates consume the same raw recovered C3D packets and
match exact readback on source-owned geometry, with shared tests for culling,
depth ordering, and palette mutation. The persistent prepared-scene
architecture now exists on both candidates: `PersistentRawC3dGpuBackend`
moves all allocation, palette mapping, and upload into a fence-completed
one-time preparation, and the hardware-proven timed path only encodes,
submits, and waits — no resource creation, upload, download, or mapping.

I08's decision lane is the correctness-gated `cmr-gpu-stage-benchmark`
(`cmr-gpu-conformance::stage_benchmark`). It reads one caller-selected imported
stage in place, composes the software stage frame as the oracle, prepares the
persistent scene once per candidate, and ranks only the steady-state
encode/submit/fence-wait interval. The gate is cross-backend byte equality plus
a documented 0.1%-of-frame nearest-neighbour sampling-tie budget against the
software oracle; a fixed-point hardware rasterizer cannot reproduce a float
software rasterizer at UV texel boundaries, and the installed-corpus worst case
is 189 of 307,200 pixels (0.062%) with the candidates identical to each other.
47 of the 60 installed EU stage scenes gate on the RTX 5090 and AMD 610M/RADV
paths; 12 see nothing at the placeholder origin camera and GR4 still hits the
unresolved 32x64 padded-layout surface case. The placeholder camera/palette and the origin
visibility limit are recorded in the evidence ledger. Captured steady-state
timings (median of three 240-frame runs after 32 warmup frames,
encode+submit / submit-to-completion in microseconds) show wgpu ahead on the
draw-heavy recovered stages: MC5 1235/98 vs 3110/91, NZ2 1296/88 vs 2253/72,
AU1 645/78 vs 1210/59 on the RTX 5090 (same ordering on RADV), while SDL_GPU
leads the 97-draw stage (66/75 vs 108/47). The CPU encode/submit interval,
which grows with prepared draw count, dominates. I09 therefore selects
**wgpu**, which also avoids SDL_GPU's external `glslangValidator` runtime
dependency, and wires it behind the shared contracts. The application's stage
and windowed-session commands now render through the persistent wgpu path by
default (`--renderer auto`), with the software compositor as the oracle and
automatic fallback: the scene is converted and uploaded once, each frame only
updates the camera VIEW matrix, and the GPU rasterizes into an 8-bit
palette-index target that the recovered indexed host presents unchanged.
Measured per 640x480 stage frame, the same workload composes in 79.6 ms
(software) vs 0.75 ms (GPU) on AU1, 67.9 vs 1.07 on NZ2, 101.4 vs 1.11 on
MC5, and 7.2 vs 0.16 on IN8. A zero-copy window presentation that skips the
index readback remains a host optimization.

An original-compatible audio lane can begin with a narrow shim for the 16
`QSWaveMix*` APIs the game imports. The shipped DLL's complete 62-export surface
is an ABI oracle, but unreferenced exports are not automatically reconstruction
requirements.

Exit gate:

- modern backends pass the same contract suite;
- no original DLL is required for the supported portable build;
- deviations from legacy behavior are intentional and documented.

## Verification budget

Use the least duplicated evidence that can establish each claim:

| Claim | Primary evidence owner | Minimum proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| artifact identity | provenance tooling | size + SHA-256 + parsed PE metadata |
| file format | format module | bounds tests + synthetic fixtures + local corpus scan |
| state transition | game subsystem | deterministic trace comparison |
| persistence | storage subsystem | byte/field round trip and negative cases |
| rendering | renderer | scene/state trace, then image comparison with tolerance |
| audio | mixer | event trace, then deterministic sample/hash window where possible |
| backend parity | platform interface | shared contract suite on both backends |
| playable path | integration owner | controlled end-to-end run with imported data |

Static analysis cannot prove runtime behavior. Runtime comparisons will be
introduced only when their environment, side effects, reset procedure, and
capture authority are explicit.
